# St-Auban-3D-modelling

This project involves developing a 3D simulation of the Saint-Aubin geography using Processing and GLSL. The application displays a textured terrain surrounded by hills, with pylons and high-voltage power lines placed above them. The project integrates minimization algorithms such as Newton-Raphson to model complex physical phenomena in the landscape.

The myVertexShader.glsl handles vertex transformations, applying effects like level lines and height-based coloring, while myFragmentShader.glsl optimizes the shading and visual effects of the terrain and pylons. Key interactive features include smooth 3D navigation, conditional display of components, and optimizations for textures and visual effects to enhance the user experience.
